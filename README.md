A experience of learning TypeScript with ChatGPT help during 5 days

## ChatGPT:
### Day 1: Understand TypeScript Basics

- Learn about TypeScript, its advantages, and why it's used
- Set up your TypeScript development environment
- Understand basic TypeScript syntax, types, and type annotations
- Learn about interfaces, classes, and functions in TypeScript

### Myself:

- TypeScript is a strict syntatical superset of JavaScript and add static typing to the language.
Possibility to have better tools at any scale. Designed to be used in large applications. One can
catch early errors in the editor. TS converts to JS to run in every place JS runs. Uses type inference
to give great tooling without additional code.

It is possible to add TS incrementally to the project, and make it catch errors not shown with just JS.
